# Code of Conduct

## Our Faith Foundation

This project is built by followers of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior.

> *"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."* — John 3:16

We believe:

- **Jesus Christ** is the Son of God who died on the cross for our sins
- **He rose again** on the third day, conquering death and sin
- **Salvation** comes through faith in Jesus Christ alone — He is the way, the truth, and the life (John 14:6)
- **We are called** to love God and love others as ourselves (Matthew 22:37-39)

This project exists to serve churches and ministries in spreading the Gospel and nurturing the faith of children through Vacation Bible School programs.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that demonstrate:
- The love of Christ
- Grace and forgiveness
- Humility and servanthood
